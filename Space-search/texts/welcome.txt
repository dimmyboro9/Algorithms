Welcome to the Pathfinding Program!

This program allows you to choose a map with a starting position and an ending position, and apply various pathfinding algorithms to find the shortest route between the two points.

You can choose from the following algorithms: random search, breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), greedy algorithm, and A* algorithm.

Once you have selected a map and an algorithm, the program will display the pathfinding process step by step, highlighting the cells visited by the algorithm and the path found from start to end.
